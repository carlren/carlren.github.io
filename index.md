#Bio

Iâ€™m a Postdoc research fellow in the Oxford Torr Vision Group, working with Professor Phil Torr.  From 2010-2014, I did my DPhil (Oxford Ph.D) in Active Vision Group, University of Oxford under then supervision of Professor Ian Reid and Professor David Murray. Before, I studied in Harbin Institute of Technology, where I received a BSc in Computer Science and Technology in Aug 2010. My research interest involves solving real-time computer vision problems, including 3D tracking and reconstruction with modern GPU.
