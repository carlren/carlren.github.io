Bio
------
My name is Yuheng (Carl) Ren, 任禹衡 in Chinese. I'm a senior research scientist in [**Fyusion, Inc.**](http://fyusion.com/), a San Francisco based startup company specialized in spatial photography, below is an example of a [**Fyuse 3D Photo**](https://fyu.se/).   
\\
Before joining Fyusion, I worked as a Postdoc research fellow in the Oxford Torr Vision Group with Professor Phil Torr.  From 2010-2014, I did my DPhil (Oxford Ph.D) in Active Vision Group, University of Oxford under then supervision of Professor Ian Reid and Professor David Murray. From 2006-2010 I studied in Harbin Institute of Technology (China), where I received a BSc in Computer Science and Technology. My research interest 
involve active vision, visual tracking, SLAM, and image-based rendering, with an emphasis on real-time implementations whenever possible.
