I'm a research scientist in [Fyusion, Inc.](http://fyusion.com/), a SF based startup company specialized in spatial photography, above is an example of our [fyu.se app](https://fyu.se/). Before joining Fyusion, I worked as a Postdoc research fellow in the Oxford Torr Vision Group with Professor Phil Torr.  From 2010-2014, I did my DPhil (Oxford Ph.D) in Active Vision Group, University of Oxford under then supervision of Professor Ian Reid and Professor David Murray.From 2006-2010 I studied in Harbin Institute of Technology, where I received a BSc in Computer Science and Technology. My research interest involves solving real-time computer vision problems, including 3D tracking and reconstruction with modern GPU.
